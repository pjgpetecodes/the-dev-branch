Your code has more bugs than a debugging tutorial.
I'd roast you, but my comments are already doing that for me.
Your variable names are so bad, they need their own debugging session.

Your error handling is like your commit messages: nonexistent.
I've seen better code written in a code golf competition.
Your algorithm is what we show as a 'what not to do' example.
Your function names sound like they were generated by a broken ChatGPT.
I'm pretty sure your code violates several laws of physics.
Your PR reviews must be fun. 'Well, at least it compiles... sometimes.'
Your debugging strategy is just 'hope and pray', isn't it?
Did you learn to code from a fortune cookie?
Your nested callbacks could open a nesting doll factory.
I've seen AI-generated code that's more readable than yours.

That logic is so twisted, it needs its own therapy session.
Your naming conventions look like a keyboard fell on them.
I'd suggest refactoring, but I don't think that's fixable.
Your code is what happens when autocomplete has trust issues.
That implementation is innovative... in the way a fire truck is a good computer.

Your codebase is a monument to technical debt.
Congratulations, you've discovered loop hell.
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed... in your PR.
Your coding style: beautiful chaos.
That's the kind of code that makes refactoring experts weep.
You know what they call that pattern? A cautionary tale.
Is your code a feature or a bug? Yes.

That's bold. I'll give you that. Seriously bold and problematic.
Somehow this code is both over-engineered and broken.
Your dependency tree is taller than your code quality.
That algorithm must've taken forever to break in exactly the right way.
Your code tastes like spaghetti. Wild, unstructured spaghetti.
