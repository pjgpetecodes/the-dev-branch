# The Dev Branch

An online multiplayer card game inspired by Cards Against Humanity, but tailored for developers! This web-based game supports 10+ players in real-time using ASP.NET Core and SignalR.

## 🎮 Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Built with SignalR for instant communication between players
- **Developer-Themed Cards**: Hundreds of cards with jokes, references, and situations familiar to developers
- **Multiple Deck Themes**: Choose a themed deck when creating a room (Default Dev Deck, Agile Team Deck)
- **Graphical Interface**: Modern, responsive UI with card animations and visual feedback
- **Scalable Architecture**: Runs on Azure App Service, ready for multiple concurrent games
- **Azure Deployment**: Infrastructure as Code with Bicep templates
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment with GitHub Actions

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Create or Join a Room**: Enter your name and a room ID
2. **Wait for Players**: Minimum 3 players required to start
3. **Card Czar**: Each round, one player is the Card Czar (indicated by 👑)
4. **Play Cards**: All players except the Czar select a white card from their hand that best fits the black card
5. **Judge**: The Card Czar picks the funniest/best combination
6. **Score**: The winner gets a point, and the role of Card Czar rotates
7. **Win**: First player to 7 points wins the game!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally

**Prerequisites**: .NET 8.0 SDK

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pjgpetecodes/the-dev-branch.git
cd the-dev-branch
```

2. Navigate to the application directory:
```bash
cd TheDevBranch
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001` (or the port shown in console)

5. To test multiplayer, open multiple browser windows or tabs

### Local Testing with Demo Mode

**Demo Mode** lets you test the entire game flow with simulated AI players without needing multiple real players.

#### Enabling Demo Mode

Demo mode is automatically activated when you start a room with the name "Pete" (case-insensitive). Simply:

1. Run the app: `dotnet run`
2. Enter your name as **"Pete"** when prompted
3. Click "Create Room" → Demo mode activates automatically
4. You'll see a blue **"🎮 Demo Player Switcher"** panel on the right

#### Using Demo Mode

The demo panel allows you to:

**Add Test Players**:
- Click the "+ Add Player" buttons to add simulated players (up to 10 total)
- Each test player is assigned a diverse, randomly-selected name
- Test players automatically play cards and participate in rounds

**Switch Player Perspectives**:
- Click any player name in the switcher to control that player
- You become that player for all actions (submitting cards, selecting winners)
- The active player is highlighted in yellow
- Useful for testing different game states and flows

**Collapse the Panel**:
- Click the panel header to minimize/maximize it
- Minimized state is remembered between page refreshes

#### Demo Mode Features

- ✅ Add up to 10 simulated players to any room
- ✅ Switch perspectives between players instantly
- ✅ Test card selection and submission flows
- ✅ Test the Card Czar's winner selection process
- ✅ Observe real-time game state updates
- ✅ Play through complete game rounds
- ✅ All game logic works identically to multiplayer mode

#### Example Demo Session

1. Start app, create room as "Pete" → Demo mode activates
2. Add 3 test players (Carlos, Maya, Diego)
3. Start the game
4. Switch to Carlos → Select a card → Submit
5. Switch to Maya → Select a card → Submit
6. Switch to Diego → Select a card → Submit
7. Switch back to Pete → See all submitted cards
8. If Pete is Card Czar, click a card group to select the winner
9. Next round begins automatically

#### Why Demo Mode is Useful

- **Solo Testing**: Test complex game flows without needing multiple people
- **Debugging**: Quickly reproduce specific game states
- **Feature Validation**: Verify new card types, game rules, and UI changes
- **Performance Testing**: Load test with multiple players on one machine

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Alternative)

You can also deploy using Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t the-dev-branch .

# Run locally
docker run -p 8080:80 the-dev-branch

# Push to container registry
docker tag the-dev-branch your-registry/the-dev-branch
docker push your-registry/the-dev-branch
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 🎨 Customizing Cards

You can customize the game by editing the card files:

- `TheDevBranch/Data/black-cards.txt`: Question/prompt cards (one per line)
- `TheDevBranch/Data/white-cards.txt`: Answer cards (one per line)
- `TheDevBranch/Data/takedowns.txt`: Snarky takedown messages (one per line)

Deck packs are stored under `TheDevBranch/Data/decks/` with metadata in `TheDevBranch/Data/decks.json`.

### Burn Mode Placeholder

If room creator enables **Burn Mode** when creating a room, card text placeholder `{{PLAYER}}` (or `{{PLAYER_NAME}}`) is replaced with random current player names at deal/draw time.
Cards containing these placeholders are treated as **burn-only cards** and are excluded entirely when Burn Mode is off.

The game automatically loads these files on startup.

## 🔧 Configuration

### App Settings

Configure in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

### Game Settings

You can modify game settings in `Models/GameRoom.cs`:

- `MaxPlayers`: Maximum players per room (default: 10)
- `WinningScore`: Points needed to win (default: 7)
